## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset:

- Height Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of player heights with and without shoes.
- Weight Analysis: Examined the distribution of player weights and its correlation with other metrics.
- Wingspan Trends: Investigated wingspan trends across different draft years.
- Vertical Jump Metrics: Studied the distribution of vertical jump heights among players.
- Agility & Sprint Times: Analyzed the agility and sprint performance of players.

## 💡 Insights
- Height Trends: The majority of players have heights between 75 to 80 inches.
